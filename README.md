System Analysis and Design

Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

DriverPass is a Drivers Education business that is seeking to expand their business to the web via a cloud-based web application where they can offer educational material such as practice tests as well as the ability to book driving lessons. 

What did you do particularly well?

Perhaps the biggest challenge of systems design is going from the idea stage of development, where DriverPass explains what it is they want, and converting that into a logical framework from which an actual functioning program can be developed from. In practice it is not too unlike a translator converting one language to another. I feel this regard is particularly suited well to my skillset as it is largely the way I approach any problem, by breaking it down into simple enough pieces that I can fundamentally understand them and thus I don't need to "remember" anything since I know how it works. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would have to say my weakest point was my diagramming. Innately I have an impatient nature and find that I learn more from doing rather than preparing. That being said I do understand the value of digramming, and how good diagrams can make the programming process far more fluid by reducing error and providing structure rather than performing your "translation" in real time. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

No matter how nifty your design may be, if it does not encompass all of the needs you client / user requested then it is not a good design. To this degree I feel it is exceptionally important that the programmer and client have a good relationship and be able to effectively communicate so that when the information gets to the programmer they have all the data they need to provide the client with the best product possible for their needs. 

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

When approaching any complex task that is more than just a couple of steps I like to start backwards. It can be difficult to figure out where to begin, much like when writing a paper for an assignment it is not that uncommon to stare at your monitor for an hour and barely have your starting paragraph. To combat this I like to start with what ever part of the project I am most confident about. In the case of DriverPass for instance it can be as simple as knowing that user's need to log on to have access to the system, so I would begin by outlining the login process, then add in the components that would make that process functional, such as user credentials, and what would happen if you did not have any. From here I would simply expand from this core point until I have reached the end on both sides, then pick another point until I have encompassed all of the client's needs.
